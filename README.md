### Hello there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Jenner, a professional data analyst.
Hi, I'm Jenner! I'm a professional data analyst with experience in over six projects. \
My skills include:
Business Analytics, Data Visualization and Storytelling, Python, SQL, Machine Learning.
I am passionate about working with large datasets and creating compelling visualizations to drive growth in communication, sales, and customer satisfaction.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currectly working a solo project to find the top selling products for Home Depot, find their best selling items per season. Reason why they are the most sold items
and how to increase the sales of their second most sold item to make more profits. Making a Tableau graph as well to this project easier to be read and understood. Previously I worked
with different companies to find their most sold items and the least ones to increase their sales for the upcoming terms. Trends created by customers to increase their sales for next season.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement automation in data management and cleaning, to make data analysis more fluent, and easier to look over and double check for
a faster way to process data. Also learning automation in software and increase my knowledge in Python for machine learning.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with Jupyter Notebook, Python or related to data analysis. Tech companies and customers driven data always excites me,
patterns are my favorite to find when analysing data.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my python and machine learning skills to improve my knowledge for future projects.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the projects I have worked in the past as I am very proud of them and the outcome these created and what I was able to learn from those companies or new skills
I was able to learn from working with them or on them.
