### Hello there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Jenner, a professional data analyst.
Hi, I'm Jenner! I'm a professional data analyst with experience in over six projects. \
My skills include:
Business Analytics, Data Visualization and Storytelling, Python, SQL, Machine Learning. 
I am passionate about working with large datasets and creating compelling visualizations to drive growth in communication, sales, and customer satisfaction.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a solo project to identify the top-selling products for Home Depot. This involves analyzing their best-selling items per season, understanding why they are the most sold items, and devising strategies to increase the sales of their second most sold items to maximize profits. I am also creating a Tableau dashboard to make the findings easier to read and understand. Previously, I have collaborated with different companies to identify their top and least sold items, aiming to boost sales for upcoming terms by analyzing customer trends.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement automation in data management and cleaning to make data analysis more efficient and error-free. Additionally, I am expanding my knowledge of Python for machine learning.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving Jupyter Notebook, Python, or any data analysis-related topics. I am particularly excited about projects involving tech companies and customer-driven data, as finding patterns in data is one of my favorite aspects of analysis.

- ðŸ¤” I am looking for guidance to improve my Python and machine learning skills for future projects.

- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about the projects I have worked on in the past. I am very proud of them and their outcomes, and I would love to share what I have learned from these experiences.
